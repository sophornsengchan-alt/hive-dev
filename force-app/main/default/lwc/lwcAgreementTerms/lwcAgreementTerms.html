                                    This Daily Deals Agreement and Individual Deal Order Form shall serve to document the terms of a Deal on the eBay Site, and upon acceptance (including via email transmission ascertaining acceptance by the Seller) shall supersede all prior agreements and 
                                    understandings (whether written or oral) between eBay and Seller, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
                                </p>

                                        Whereas, eBay runs a program (<b>“Daily Deals Program”</b>) on one or more eBay websites, including www.ebay.com, in which selected sellers offer items for sale at discounted prices in return for certain assistance by eBay to market those items to buyers; and 
                                        Whereas, Seller is a registered user of eBay services and wishes to participate in the Daily Deals Program.                        
                                    </p>

                                <p> 
                                    Now therefore, for good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, eBay and Seller hereby agree as follows:
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                    <b>1.	Deals.</b> During the Term (as defined below), Seller may be contacted by eBay and invited to list one or more items (collectively or individually referred to as
                                    <b>“Specified Item”</b>, as applicable) on the eBay Site (as defined below) at discounted prices for a specified period of time 
                                    (<b>“Deal”</b>). For certain Deals and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, eBay may agree to pay a Subsidy Payment (defined below) to Seller to apply towards the discounted price of the Specified Item 
                                    (<b>“Subsidized Deal”</b>).For each Deal, eBay and Seller will agree to the terms in writing, which may include email or through an online Deal submission portal, including at minimum the terms identified in Addendum C. 
                                    For each Subsidized Deal, eBay will transmit the terms for the Subsidized Deal to Seller in writing, which may include email or through an online Deal submission portal, substantially in the form of Schedule 1 (attached to this Agreement). 
                                    Seller shall confirm acceptance of the terms of the Subsidized Deal in writing, which may include email or through an online Deal submission portal. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern each Deal, including each Subsidized Deal, 
                                    and Seller’s participation in the Daily Deals Program. All terms for a specific Deal as agreed between eBay and Seller, including the terms of this Agreement, the terms in Addendum C, and Schedule 1 (for a Subsidized Deal) are referred to as the 
                                    <b>“Deal Terms.”</b> Deal Terms may only be changed upon the mutual agreement of eBay and Seller in writing, which may include email or through an online Deal submission portal.

                                    On the Deal Start Date/Time specified in the Deal Terms, Seller shall reduce the price of the Specified Item listed on the eBay Site to the Deal Price specified in the Deal Terms.  Seller shall list the Specified Item, with an accurate description of the Specified Item and its condition (e.g. new or refurbished), 
                                    on the eBay Site in accordance with the Deal Terms for the duration of the Deal.  Seller shall maintain the price of the Specified Item on the eBay Site at or below the Deal Price until the Deal Stop Date/Time as specified in the Deal Terms. Upon the conclusion of the Deal, Seller shall immediately increase the price of the Specified Item to the List Price (defined below) or a higher price.  
                                    eBay and Seller will each track the number of Specified Items sold on the eBay Site during the duration of the Deal. Seller shall strictly enforce the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser) (defined below) including without limitation, use of commercially reasonable efforts to check each address to which the Specified Item is shipped to confirm compliance with the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser).  
                                    <b>“Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser)”</b> means the maximum number of Specified Items that may be purchased by a single buyer as described in Schedule 1. For purposes of the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser), any buyer of a Specified Item that has the same address as another buyer (even if such buyer has a different User ID), 
                                    or is otherwise working in concert with a larger group of buyers (whether formal agents of such buyer or not) shall be considered a “single buyer,” and shall be subject to the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser).  Seller acknowledges that eBay does not guarantee any sales from any Deal, whether or not subsidized.

                                    <b>“eBay Site”</b>, as applicable).  Seller is subject to compliance with the eBay User Agreement, the eBay Privacy Policy, and all other policies applicable to Seller for the eBay Site (collectively, 
                                    <b>“eBay Policies”</b>), which are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. In the event there is a conflict between the eBay Policies and this Agreement concerning a Deal or the Daily Deals Program, then the eBay Policies will control.

                                    Each Specified Item shall be offered with a price that is no greater than the price Seller charges purchasers for such Specified Item through any of Seller’s other distribution channels, with the exception of third party sites which are not controlled by Seller.
                
                                </p>

                                    <b>5.	Price Claims and Seller Discount. </b>
                                    For each Deal, Seller shall provide eBay with the List Price of the Specified Item (defined below) in which eBay may display on the eBay Site with a description of the Deal. The  
                                    <b>“List Price”</b> means the price (excluding shipping and handling fees, tax and duty, as applicable) at which the Seller, or the market generally, offers the Specified Item, or an item that is nearly identical to the Specified Item, for sale in good faith to buyers in the general public for a substantial period of time without discount. 
                                    Seller shall inform eBay whether the List Price is based on Seller’s own pricing or the pricing of other sellers in the market.  
                                    <br></br>
                                    Seller represents and warrants to eBay that: (a) the List Price of the Specified Item provided by Seller to eBay is a reasonable representation of the undiscounted price at which buyers in the general public would be able to purchase the Specified Item in new condition if the Specified Item is new, 
                                    or in refurbished condition if the Specified Item is refurbished; and (b) Seller has offered the Specified Item for sale at the List Price to buyers in the general public for at least ninety (90) of the one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Deal Start Date/Time, or at least fifty percent (50%) of the sales made by Seller, 
                                    or all sellers in the market which sell the Specified Item, in the twelve (12) months prior to the Deal Start Date/Time were made at the List Price.
                                    <br></br>
                                    Seller shall maintain a complete record to support the representations and warranties about the List Price made by Seller in this Section including, the locations, dates and times for which Seller offered to sell the Specified Item at the List Price, or the locations, date and times for which Seller found other sellers in the market offering to sell the Specified Item.  
                                    On request from eBay, Seller shall provide such records to eBay promptly.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall substantiate and document all claims made by Seller regarding the Specified Item – including, without limitation, claims related to performance, efficacy, price and/or savings for the Specified Item and products or services offered by Seller in connection with the Specified Item – in accordance with all applicable laws. 
                                    Seller authorizes eBay to display a “% off” or “up to % off” on the eBay Site in connection with the Deal and based on the percentage difference between the List Price and the Deal Price described in the Deal Terms, to represent a discount to the List Price for the Specified Item. 
                                    <br></br>
                                    Seller acknowledges that eBay is relying on Seller’s representation and warranties related to the List Price and the Specified Item and agrees that Seller shall be solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws related to the Deal offered by Seller on the eBay Site, including without limitation, 
                                    all applicable laws related to pricing claims.

                                    Seller shall seek the independent advice of a qualified attorney at Seller’s own expense with any questions Seller may have regarding compliance with laws or pricing claims in connection with the Deal.

Seller Purchase Restrictions.</b> In no event shall Seller or any affiliate of Seller purchase the Specified Items in a Deal on any eBay Site, and Seller shall not collude with any third party to purchase or buy-back any Specified Item offered in a Deal for the benefit of Seller or any affiliate of Seller or to circumvent the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser) or any other aspect of the Deals Program.  
                                    Seller shall strictly enforce the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser) including without limitation, use of commercially reasonable efforts to check each address to which the Specified Item is shipped to confirm compliance with the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser) and will use extra precautions in the event a buyer uses a freight forwarder address which might be utilized as a common address with another buyer. 
                                    Seller shall not sell any Specified Item to a buyer which uses multiple user-IDs, registers new user-IDs, or uses an unregistered account, in each case for the purpose of circumventing the Quantity Limitation (Per Purchaser).
